						<h3>
							Additional provisions in respect of Members
						</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Members in full Communion and good standing have the right to all the privileges of Church membership. They have 
								direct access to the Congregational Board and, through the Board, to Council, and through the Council to Synod, 
								by Petition.
							</li>
							<li>
								All persons being admitted into membership must do so with the knowledge and approval of the Congregational Board.
							</li>
							<li>
								In addition to the duties specified in the Constitution, the following is expected of members:
								<p>
									<ol type="a">
										<li>
											<i>Worship:</i> members must be punctual and regular at Divine Worship and at Holy Communion, and must 
											conduct themselves in a seemly manner, entering the house of God quietly and reverently and maintaining 
											a reverent spirit throughout the service, remembering the promise of Jesus, “Where two or three are 
											gathered together in My Name, there am I in the midst of them.”
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Witnessing:</i> All members should seek to bring others to Christ using whatever skill they have from 
											God.
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Serving:</i> Members should take an active interest in the Church School and all other organisations of 
											the Church. Every member should belong to one of the groups in the Church, e.g. the Choir, men’s Fellowship, 
											Women’s Fellowship, the Young Adults, etc., and should also give some time to voluntary work in the Church.
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Giving:</i> Members are to tithe and contribute liberally and regularly to the funds of the Church for the 
											support of Gospel Ordinances and Ministerial, Congregational, Synodical and Missionary work.
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Conduct:</i> Members are to refrain from sexual immorality (including fornication, adultery and homosexuality), 
											drunkenness, dishonest business practices, and any other thing which dishonours the Name of Christ, and tends to 
											demoralise themselves or others.
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Disputes:</i> In cases of disputes involving members, they are expected to refer the matter first to the Church
											for peaceful settlement, rather than to Civil Courts (1 Cor. 6: 1 – 11).
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Discipline:</i> Members are in duty bound to attend meetings of the Congregational Board when summoned. Refusal 
											will result in suspension.
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Family Life:</i> It is the duty of all members to gather for family worship and to regulate family life so that 
											it’s a living witness for Christ in the community.
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Baptism:</i> Members desiring to have their children baptised, must arrange with the Minister in advance of the 
											day on which the Sacrament may be administered in order that the true meaning of this Sacrament may be explained.
										</li>
										<li>
											<i>Church School:</i> It is the duty of members to ensure that children attend Church School and any other meetings 
											and practices held for children, regularly and punctually.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Upon request, any member in good standing may have his/her membership transferred to another congregation/Denomination by letter 
								from the minister.
							</li>
							<li>
								Persons being transferred from other denominations shall be required to attend the candidate’s classes before being admitted into 
								membership.
							</li>
							<li>
								Members who are not in full communion and good standing shall be classified as “inactive members” until they again become in full 
								communion and good standing or until they cease to be members. Members may also be subject to suspension in accordance with the 
								Disciplinary Procedures of the Church. Members suspended for any reason cannot be restored to full fellowship without satisfying
								the Congregational Board as to their repentance. Restoration may be in private or in public as the board deems fit.
							</li>
							<li>
								A member shall cease to be a member and must be taken off the Communion Roll (the roll of members) upon:
								<p>
									<ol type="a">
										<li>
											Having his/her membership transferred to another congregation/Denomination.
										</li>
										<li>
											Excommunication under the Disciplinary Procedures of the Church.
										</li>
										<li>
											Resigning his/her membership, or requesting the removal of his/her name from the roll of members, by written notice/request.
										</li>
										<li>
											The Congregational Board having reasonably concluded, after due enquiry (notwithstanding that a written notice was not obtained), 
											that an inactive member is unlikely to resume the duties required of members in full communion and good standing in the congregation. 
											A minute shall be maintained of all such conclusions of the Congregational Board, signed by the Minister and Secretary (or the person(s)											
											then duly acting as chairperson and/or secretary of the meeting). Nothing herein shall preclude a member so removed from being restored 
											to membership by an act of restoration.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								A Minister shall be a member of the congregation in which the Induction Service took place.
								<p>
									<ol type="a">
										<li>
											Although it is desirable that the names of the minister’s spouse and children appear on the same membership roll (assuming they are 
											members of the United Church), the final decision as to where they attach their membership remains with each individual.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Persons residing overseas and who wish to retain their membership with their particular United Church (their home Church) will be allowed to do 
								so once they are in contact with their particular United Church through an Elder (who is assigned to deal with these persons). No contact for a 
								period in excess of two years will result in a loss of their membership.
							</li>
							<li>
								Members shall meet together in Congregational Meeting as provided in the Constitution.
								<p>
									<ol type="a">
										<li>
											The Congregational Meeting shall elect the Elders and Officers, approve the annual Budget of the Congregation, receive from the 
											Congregational Board the annual financial accounts and the reports of the congregational auditors, and generally have the right to 
											debate and deliberate upon all matters affecting the life of the Congregation, except the Communion (Membership) Roll, the Sacraments 
											and Discipline.
										</li>
										<li>
											The Members shall cause minutes to be made and kept recording the proceedings of all Meetings. Once they are approved at a subsequent 
											Meeting, the chairperson of the Meeting or the chairperson of the next Meeting at which the minutes of the earlier Meeting are approved, 
											shall sign the minutes. When so signed, the minutes cannot be altered, and any change later authorised by a Congregational Meeting shall 
											be inserted in the minutes of that subsequent Meeting.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Election of Elders
						</h3>
						<p>
							At the end of each calendar year, normally the number of Elders nearest to one-third shall retire from office (but shall be eligible for re-election). 
							The Elders retiring under the preceding sentence shall be those who have been longest in office since last being elected or re-elected. Where the full 
							one-third number cannot be established in that way, the Board shall agree the names of the other Elders who shall retire at the end of the year. The names 
							of the Elders to retire at the end of each year shall be determined before the last scheduled Congregational Meeting for that year. At the last scheduled 
							Congregational Meeting in each year, the new Elders shall be elected (or re-elected, as the case may be) to fill the vacancies expected at the end of the 
							year and to take office from the 1st January following. The Elders shall be elected from a slate of nominees recommended by the Nomination Committee hereinafter 
							provided for and/or from any nominees nominated from the floor by any member entitled to vote at the Meeting (provided such nominee has agreed to serve). 
							(In order to allow a period of personal refreshment, more participation, fresh energy and new thinking, as far as it is possible, different members should be 
							nominated to fill at least some of the vacancies arising at that time, rather than all the retiring Elders being nominated for immediate re-election.)<br>
							Consequent on the provisions of the Constitution requiring the affirmative vote of two-thirds of those present at the Congregational Meeting at which the 
							voting for the election of the Elder is to take place, when there are more nominees than the number of Elders to be elected, those persons equal to the number 
							of vacancies to be filled who receive the greatest number of votes shall be deemed the Elected Nominees. Any Elected Nominee who had received the votes of at 
							least two-thirds of the members present at the time of voting shall be declared to have been duly elected an Elder. A second round of voting shall then 
							immediately be held, by private ballot, to affirm or otherwise the election as Elders of the remaining Elected Nominees. Any Elected Nominee then receiving 
							affirmative votes of at least two-thirds of the members then present shall be declared to have been duly elected an Elder. If all vacancies have not been 
							filled in this way, the Minister shall arrange for further nominations and elections to take place at a later date.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Duties of the Board

								to Council and deliberate on matters to be referred to Council and, in general, direct the total programme of the church and, in the Name and in the Spirit of 
								Christ, exercise the disciplinary functions of the Congregation in accordance with the procedures detailed in the Constitution. To this end, the Elders:

								Any committees so appointed by the Board may be made up of Elders, members or adherents (provided that the number of adherents on any such committee does not 
								exceed one-quarter of the total number of its members) and shall act in accordance with the objectives, terms and conditions approved by the Board. The Minister 
								shall be, ex-officio, a member of all committees appointed by the Board. The Congregational Board may delegate such of its powers as it deems advisable to any 
								committee so appointed and may set limits and conditions for the exercise of any delegated powers. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, each congregation

										Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Special meetings of the Board may be called at any time at the request of the Minister (or 
										the person deputizing for the Minister pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution), provided that due notice of such meeting is given in time (but it 
										shall not be necessary to state the particular business to be considered at a meeting, whether a regular or special meeting). Every Elder present at a Meeting 
										shall have one vote, either by show of hands or by ballot. The chairperson of the Meeting has no deliberative vote, but in cases of equality, where the 
										decision is to be decided on by simple majority of the votes cast, s/he has a casting vote. Unless and except where specifically provided otherwise in the 
										Constitution or these Bye-Laws, questions shall be decided by simple majority of the votes cast for or against a motion.<br>
										The Board shall cause minutes to be made and kept recording the proceedings of all Meetings. Once they are approved at a subsequent Meeting, the chairperson 
										of the Meeting or the chairperson of the next Meeting at which the minutes of the earlier Meeting are approved, shall sign the minutes. When so signed, the 
										minutes cannot be altered, and any change later authorised by a meeting of the Congregational Board shall be inserted in the minutes of that subsequent Meeting.
