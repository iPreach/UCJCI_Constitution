			</h2>
			<h2>
				Section 1: Constitution of Synod
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Synod is the Supreme Court of the Church, and consists of all members of The Regional Mission Councils.
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						<h3>
							Functions:
						</h3>
						<p>
							The functions of the Synod are judicial, legislative and administrative. It gives judgement in cases 
							which are brought before it. It deliberates on matters which concern the whole Church in her doctrine, 
							worship, discipline, government and administration and declares the Church's decision on any such matter. 
							The Synod makes rules for the regulation of its own procedure and the procedure of the lower Courts. 
							It inspects Regional Mission Councils, examines records, takes care that they observe the rules and 
							procedures of the Church, exhorts Regional Mission Councils, appoints full-time workers for Synod ventures, 
							regulates and superintends the training of students for the Ministry, seeks to promote the unity of the 
							Congregations under its care, maintains correspondence with Partner Churches at home and abroad, directs 
							the missionary work of the Church and promotes the extension of the Gospel throughout the world. It assesses 
							the Congregations through Regional Mission Councils in order to provide funds for carrying on this work.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Declaration of Synod:
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Synod from time to time declares the mind of the Church in matters of doctrine, worship, discipline and 
							government in order to determine and regulate its constitution and laws. This may be done by a Declaratory Act, 
							which declares for the guidance of the Church what the Synod holds to be the law of the Church on any point on 
							which questions have been raised. Such a Declaratory Act referring to doctrine or constitution must be sent down 
							to The Regional Mission Councils, but on matters of difficulty should be sent to The Regional Mission Councils 
							under the Referral Act, before Synod passes them into the law, at least one year later.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Rights of Review:
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Synod has a general right of review extending to decisions and resolutions of Regional Mission Councils 
							and matters brought before it by reference, by protest and appeal, by protest and complaint and by dissent.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Examination of Records:
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Synod receives, in the manner prescribed, annual reports from all Regional Mission Councils concerning the life 
							and work of the Church. The Synod exercises the right of review through the periodical examination of the records of 
							Regional Mission Councils. The Synod examines these records either by itself or by a Committee or Committees.
						</p>
						<p>	
							<ol>
								<li>
									It pronounces judgement as to the correctness and accuracy with which each record is kept, requires serious 
									errors to be rectified and instructs Regional Mission Councils as to improvements that may be adopted in 
									their mode of conducting business.
								</li>
								<li>
									It may for sufficient reasons review and recall any decision of a Regional Mission Council appearing on record. 
									The Synod may order sections of The Regional Mission Council's record to be deleted or amended. This may be carried 
									out by the Regional Mission Council or General Secretary of Synod under the order of Synod. The minutes of Synod 
									ordering the deletion must be inserted in the record. Before pronouncing any judgement with respect to any 
									deliverance of a Regional Mission Council or before ordering the Minutes of a Regional Mission Council to be altered 
									the Synod must hear the Regional Mission Council.
								</li>
								<li>
									The Synod may find that a certain procedure of a Regional Mission Council has been ultra vires or contrary to the rules 
									of the Church and may declare it to be null and void or order the Minutes to be altered. Before doing so it must hear 
									the Regional Mission Council.
								</li>
								<li>
									If it appears to the Synod that a Regional Mission Council has failed to deal with a matter that calls for enquiry, 
									the Synod may instruct the Regional Mission Council to proceed in the matter according to the laws of the Church; 
									and may where it seems desirable, appoint Assessors to assist the Regional Mission Council.<br><br>
									(The Regional Mission Council exercises a like right of review over Congregational Boards)
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Open Court:
						</h3>
						<p>
							This Synod is an open Court but has a right to deliberate in private, when this is considered necessary.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Committee of Whole House:
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Synod for the greater freedom of discussion has the power of resolving itself into a Committee of the whole house, in which 
							case the Moderator leaves the chair and a Chairperson is appointed.<br>
							A separate Minute is taken of the proceedings of the Committee. When the Synod resumes, the Moderator takes the chair and the 
							Minutes of the Committee are read. The resolution or resolutions formed by it are then read and without discussion are approved 
							and sanctioned as the determination of the Synod.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Remit to a Committee:
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Synod reserves to itself the right of sending any cause brought before it, to a Committee to consider the matter and to report 
							to the Court.
