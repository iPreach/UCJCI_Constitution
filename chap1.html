			<h2>
				Section 1: Rights and Duties of Members
			</h2>
			<p>
				Members of a Congregation are persons who have been received into full communion by profession of faith in Jesus Christ as 
				Saviour and Lord through Baptism/Confirmation or transfer or on restoration or by re-affirmation of faith in the absence of 
				a certificate/letter of transfer.<br>
				It is the duty as well as joy and privilege for members of the Church to attend regularly the services of the Church, to 
				become actively involved in all the functions of the Church, to contribute regularly and systematically to the financial 
				support of the Church and to enjoy or abide by the other privileges and responsibilities as contained in the By-Laws.<br>
				Members in full communion and good standing are those who faithfully perform their duties.<br>
				Members who fail to perform their duties will be considered delinquent and will stand in need of special encouragement and 
				counselling on the part of the Minister and Elders of the Church.<br>
				If a member is absent from Holy Communion for more than one year excepting for reasons which must be satisfactory to the 
				Congregational Board, that member is no longer considered to be in full communion and good standing.<br>
				Persons who have been dedicated to God by infant baptism or blessing, and adherents are under the pastoral care of the Church 
				and are to be considered as part of the constituents of the Church.<br>
				Only members in full communion have a right to take part in the business of Congregational Meetings. They have direct access 
				to the Congregational Board with submissions. In all submissions there is an appeal to the higher Courts. Through the 
				Congregational Board they have access to Regional Mission Councils and through Regional Mission Councils to Synod.

				Section 2: Congregational Meetings and Congregational Board
			</h2>
			<p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						<h3>
							The Congregational Meeting
						</h3>
						<p>
							In each Congregation there shall be held at least three times per year, a Congregational Meeting. All members in 
							full communion shall be entitled to be present and to vote. Normally the Minister will preside. If the Minister is 
							unable to do so, the meeting shall be presided over by the one of the following persons where such a person has been 
							duly commissioned, elected or appointed within the congregation, in the order of priority listed, namely the Associate 
							Minister, Lay Pastor, or Deputy Chairperson of the Congregational Board. Where this is not possible, the meeting shall 
							elect a Chairperson from among its members. Should the Minister or other ex-officio Chairperson aforesaid arrive late, 
							he/she shall assume the Chair for the remainder of the meeting. Subject thereto, the meetings shall be convened, 
							constituted and their proceedings conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution and its Bylaws in 
							force from time to time.<br>
							In the event there are exceptional circumstances which require the calling of a special meeting by the Minister, it may 
							be called in a shorter period than hereinafter provided or notice may be waived. Otherwise, notice of all Congregational 
							Meetings, specifying the date, time and place of the meeting, shall be given by the Minister. This shall be announced in 
							the regular worship services for at least two clear Sundays preceding the date fixed for the meeting.<br>
							No business shall be conducted at a Congregational Meeting unless a quorum is present when the meeting proceeds to business. 
							Each congregation shall establish, by resolution duly approved at a Congregational Meeting of which notice to pass such a 
							resolution has been duly given as aforesaid, the quorum for its Congregational Meetings. The quorum may be changed from time 
							to time, to take account of the applicable circumstances of the congregation, by resolution approved in the manner aforesaid.<br>
							Except where specifically provided otherwise in the Constitution or these Bylaws, questions shall be decided by simple majority 
							of the votes cast for or against a motion. Every Member in full communion and good standing present at a Congregational Meeting 
							shall have one vote, either by show of hands or by ballot. The chairperson of the Meeting has no vote.<br>
							The word “Minister” as used on this Chapter One and the corresponding section of the Bylaws shall be interpreted to include the 
							“Interim Minister” appointed while the position of Minister is vacant in the Congregation.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							The Congregational Board
						</h3>
						<p>
							Each Congregation shall elect or re-elect (subject to the principle of rotation set out in the By-Laws) from among its members, 
							suitable persons to serve as Elders for three year periods NB. Persons who were ordained as Life Elders prior to 1972 in the former
							United Church of Jamaica and Grand Cayman or who were ordained as Life Elders by the former Disciples of Christ before the union in 
							1992, do not cease to be Elders under the foregoing procedures, though they may elect not to be a serving Elder for any year, by 
							giving written notice to the Minister before the last Congregational Meeting of the preceding year. The number of Elders to be 
							appointed to the Congregational Board shall be determined by the Congregation, based on its number of members and other factors 
							considered relevant, but shall not be less than five (5). Elections shall be held by secret ballot, each member present having 
							one vote for each vacancy due to be filled at the meeting.<br>
							An Elder shall be elected when at least two-thirds of those present at the Congregational Meeting at the time the Meeting proceeded 
							to vote voted in favour of the nominee.<br>
							Any casual vacancy occurring in the number of Elders serving in any year may be filled by election at a Congregational Meeting in the 
							same manner outlined above.<br>
							The Elders when duly elected and set apart, shall constitute, along with the Minister (and, where such a person is then so serving in 
							the Congregation, the Associate Minister or Lay Pastor), the Congregational Board. The continuing Congregational Board may act 
							notwithstanding any vacancy in their body. The Congregational Board shall also include, either the President or the Secretary of the 
							Youth Fellowship who shall sit on the Board but with no right to vote.<br>
							Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the Congregational Board shall be presided over by the Minister, Associate Minister, Lay 
							Pastor or Deputy Chairperson. There shall be a Deputy Chairperson who shall be an Elder appointed by the Congregation and who shall 
							preside over meetings of the Congregational Board (or portions of such meetings) as requested so to do by the Minister, and shall also 
							preside at meetings held in the absence of the Minister, the Associate Minister or Lay Pastor. In the absence of all the foregoing 
							persons, the meeting shall be presided over by the Graduate Intern assigned to the congregation and otherwise by an Elder chosen by 
							the meeting.<br>
							The Congregational Board shall be the local executive body, and shall normally meet monthly. Persons who are not members of the Congregational 
							Board may only attend by invitation.
