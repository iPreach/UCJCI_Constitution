							The Ministry
						</h2>
						<p>
							To the Church is committed the trust of proclaiming Christ in word and deed. Every member is called to participate in the worshipping, witnessing, 
							serving life of the whole Church. This is a part of the Priesthood of all believers.<br>
							The Ministry of Word and Sacraments, pastoral care and counselling are God's gifts to His Church. Some persons are set apart by Ordination for 
							this Ministry. This ordained Ministry is exercised within the Priesthood of the whole Church.<br>
							The oversight of the preaching of the Word and the administration of the Sacraments; the pastoral care and counselling of the people, and the 
							provision for the perpetuation of this ministry through the rite of ordination are the permanent functions of the ordained ministry.<br>
							Candidates for the Ministry at the time of Union shall, after the Union, have the same status as before. Those accepted for ordination shall 
							be commissioned and ordained as Ministers by the authority of Synod.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							The Sacraments
						</h2>
						<h3>
							Baptism
						</h3>
						<p>
							While the operations of Divine Grace cannot be limited by us, means of grace were instituted by the Lord Jesus Christ by which we are united 
							to God and through which God works in us. The United Church believes that the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are two such means 
							of grace.<br>
							Inasmuch as the uniting Churches have historically administered the Sacrament of Baptism through various forms, to both infants and adults, 
							but with a fundamental agreement as to the meaning of baptism; the United Church shall administer baptism to infants as well as adults with 
							water by either immersion or sprinkling in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Sacrament of Baptism shall be administered by an 
							ordained minister, or by one who has received authority thereto by the Church.
						</p>
						<h3>
							The Lord's Supper
						</h3>
						<p>
							The observance of the Lord's Supper by the United Church is varied, both in frequency of observance and in the liturgical form of the service. 
							The frequency of observance and any form of service in use by any of the uniting Churches may be used.<br>
							The celebration of the Lord's Supper shall be entrusted to those who have been ordained, or to those who have received authority local or Synodical, thereto by the Church.
						</p>						
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							Members
						</h2>
						<p>
							All persons who are members of the uniting Communions at the time of the Union, shall be members of the United Church.<br>
							New members shall be admitted into the fellowship of the United Church through baptism/ confirmation, or profession of faith in Christ as Lord 
							and Saviour, or by Certificate of Transfer from other recognized denominations.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							Organisation of Synodical Committees
						</h2>
						<p>
							The Synod of the United Church shall appoint its Central Mission Council as well as Standing Committees to carry out its regular business.

							funds shall be vested in the Synod of the United Church.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							Approval and Implemantation of the Basis of Union
						</h2>
						<p>
							The basis of Union shall be submitted to the Synods of the United Church of Jamaica and Grand Cayman, and the Disciples of Christ in Jamaica.<br>
							Each shall proceed according to its own polity in the approval or disapproval of the Basis of Union.<br>
							When the Basis has been approved by the regular action of the two Bodies, the President of the Disciples of Christ and the Moderator of the United 
							Church Synod shall together call a joint meeting of the Synods.<br>
							The Joint meeting, being duly called and assembled, shall receive the reports upon the Basis of Union from the two Communions and shall declare by 
							joint resolution, that union of the two Communions be effected at that time. The joint meeting shall become the first Synod of the United Church in 
							Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, and shall be the successor of the Synods of the two uniting Churches.<br>
							From the time of the United Synod mentioned above, the Basis of the Union adopted shall regulate the affairs of the Church until a constitution be 
							worked out and adopted.<br>
							The Synod of the United Church, at its first meeting, shall take appropriate steps to ensure the continuity and to effect the consolidation of all 
							Boards and Agencies of the two uniting Communions, and to make effective an interim plan for their continued operation.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							Revision and Amendments
						</h2>
						<p>
							Revision and Amendments of the Basis of Union, while it is in force before the adoption of a Constitution, may be made by the consent of two thirds 
							(2/3) of the members of the Synod of the United Church duly assembled.
