				Chapter Five - Disciplinary Procedures</center>

			<p>
				<i>(From the Synod Papers of the 1995 Synod of the UCJCI)</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>
							General Principles
						</h3>
						<p>
							The basis for Church Discipline is an offence which is calculated to bring reproach on the Church and the Christian Faith. 
							The ends contemplated by discipline are the maintenance of the Church's purity and the spiritual benefit of the members. 
							It is one of the ordinances appointed by our Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament (Matthew 18:15-18). Persons should be 
							treated justly regardless of age, status, social position, wealth or any other such consideration. The whole proceedings 
							ought to be distinguished by faithfulness to God's Word and gentleness to the offender.<br>
							The hope should be that the disciplinary action might lead to eventual growth in grace (2 Corinthians 2:6-11).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Grounds for Disciplinary Action
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Conduct</b>: Sexual immorality (including fornication, adultery and homosexual acts), drunkenness, dishonest business 
							practices, and any other thing which dishonours the Name of Christ or tends to demoralise members or others.<br>
							<b>Disputes</b>: In cases of disputes involving members, they are expected to refer the matter first to the Church for 
							peaceful settlement, rather than to the civil courts (1 Corinthians 6:1-11).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Subjects of Discipline
						</h3>
						<p>
							The persons who are subject to discipline are Ministers, full-time workers, lay pastors, elders or deacons, members, and 
							all other persons who are under the authority of Synod.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Modes of Discipline
						</h3>
						<p>
							The modes of discipline are:
							<ol tyoe="a">
								<li>
									<h3>
										Admonition
									</h3>
									<p>
										This is the lowest degree of Church censure. It consists in solemnly addressing the offender, placing the offence 
										before the person, and exhorting the person to greater rectitude.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>
										Rebuke
									</h3>
									<p>
										This is a more severe form of censure involving stern words of reproof.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>
										Suspension
									</h3>
									<p>
										This is a temporary exclusion from all the privileges of full communion and other rights of membership. Suspension may 
										or may not be for a specified time, and is removed as soon as sufficient cause for its removal appears. Suspension of 
										an office bearer is uniformly accompanied by suspension from office. In the case of a Minister, suspension from office 
										may be accompanied by removal from his/her charge.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>
										Deposition
									</h3>
									<p>
										This consists in depriving an office bearer of office with which the person is vested in consequence of some gross 
										immorality, dangerous heresy, or contemptuous resistance of the authority of the Church courts.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>
										Excommunication
									</h3>
									<p>
										This is the most severe form of Church censure and consists of solemnly casting the offender out of the Church. It is to 
										be resorted to only in cases of peculiar aggravation, when all other means have failed, and when the offender continues 
										impenitent and contemptuous of the courts of the Church.
									</p>

						<h3>
							Discipline of Elders and Members of the Church
						</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Inuiry into Scandal
								</h3>
								<p>
									Inquiry is made only by the authority of the congregation to which the person belongs at the time of the report. If after the 
									lapse of five years no judicial action has been taken on the offence, it cannot be considered by the Board.<br>
									A Congregational Board may take up a case of discipline either on a charge by an individual member or on the ground of public 
									report.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Private Settlement
								</h3>
								<p>
									In the case of a private offence, it is the duty of a member of the Church, before bringing a charge against another member, 
									to have recourse to private settlement agreeable to our Lord's precept in Matthew 18:15-17. Unless this course has been followed 
									without satisfaction, the person is not warranted in bringing the complaint before the Board.<br>
									If the member thus complaining does not obtain satisfaction, the person should report to the Minister or Elder/Deacon of his/her 
									district who may seek assistance to converse with both parties with the view of settling the case amicably.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Matters to be Brought to the Board
								</h3>
								<p>
									When the Elder has failed to settle a matter amicably, it should be brought to the Congregational Board. If the offence has reached 
									the Board through public report, the Minister may enquire into the matter with a view to bringing the party or parties to repentance. 
									If this fails, or if the matter is a scandal which may bring reproach on the Church, or the Christian faith, it should be brought to 
									the Board.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Notice to Party
								</h3>
								<p>
									The party or parties accused should be given full details of the charge brought against them and should be summoned to appear at a 
									meeting to be held not less than fourteen (14) days after the summons has been delivered.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Serving of Summons
								</h3>
								<p>
									The summons should be in writing and may be served either by mailing it to the accused or by leaving it at the home of the accused.<br>
									Before a written summons is served, the Minister, accompanied by a witness, may serve the first summons by word of mouth.<br>
									In all cases the accused should be informed that he/she may bring witnesses.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Failure to Appear
								</h3>
								<p>
									If a party does not appear after a second summons, which must be in writing, has been served, the accused shall be suspended from 
									membership for contempt of the Courts of the Church. If the matter is a grave offence, trial in the absence of the accused may be 
									proceeded upon by the Board.<br>
									Such absence, except there is reasonable excuse, will be interpreted as a design to avoid conviction and censure.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Confession
								</h3>
								<p>
									If the accused appears, the charge is stated to him/her. He/She is asked whether he/she admits it, and is fully heard. If he confesses, 
									it may be expedient to have his/her confession in writing, have it signed by him, and then recorded in the Minutes of the Board. Even 
									if it is not in writing, it should be recorded in the minutes of the Board.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Denial
								</h3>
								<p>
									If the accused denies the charges, then the trial proceeds including the calling of relevant witnesses if necessary.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Witness
								</h3>
								<p>
									All members of the Church are bound to attend when summoned as witnesses, and are liable to censure if they refuse. Persons who are not 
									members of the Church can only be requested to attend or give evidence.<br>
									The examination of witnesses is conducted in the presence of the accused, but may proceed in his absence if he fails to attend (as in 
									number 6).<br>
									When the evidence on both sides is closed, the parties may comment on it as they may choose.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Deliberation and Judgement
								</h3>
								<p>
									Parties having been heard, the Board proceeds to deliberate with the view to arriving at a judgement. It may delay judgement, or refer 
									the case to a superior Court. Any party refusing to accept the judgement of the Court is suspended from membership for contempt.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Membership Status of the Accused
								</h3>
								<p>
									No member against whom a charge is pending or who is under suspicion may be transferred from their congregation to another. Any reception 
									into membership granted to such a person by any congregation is void.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Persons Resisting Discipline by Turning to Other Denominations
								</h3>
								<p>
									Persons who refuse to submit to discipline by becoming members of another denomination should not be received back into fellowship of the 
									Church unless they acknowledge their additional offence and submit to the original disciplinary measures which they sought to evade.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Restoration to Membership
								</h3>
								<p>
									A member who has been disciplined by a Court of the Church may be restored to full membership only after sincere repentance. Such restoration 
									must be in public.<br>
									Where suspension has been for a specified period of time, the accused shall appear before the Board at the expiry of the period of time. When 
									the suspension is for an indefinite period of time, application may be made to the Court for the removal of the censure after a reasonable time
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Restoration to Office
								</h3>
								<p>
									Restoration to membership does not automatically mean restoration to office. The latter is not to take place despite evident repentance unless 
									the general interest of the Christian faith will be advanced and not injured by the step.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Appeals
								</h3>
								<p>
									Any person convicted by a Congregational Board has the right of appeal to The Regional Mission Council and from The Regional Mission Council 
									to the Synod.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>
							Discipline of Ministers, Lay Pastors, Interns and Other Full-Time Workers
						</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Proper Court
								</h3>
								<p>
									The Regional Mission Council is the proper Court for the trial of Ministers, Lay Pastors, Interns and other Full-Time Workers. Normally all 
									processes against a Minister, Lay Pastor, Intern, or other Full-Time Worker begin before The Regional Mission Council to which the person 
									belongs.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Disciplinary Committee
								</h3>
								<p>
									For this purpose each Regional Mission Council shall establish a Disciplinary Committee consisting of the Chairperson and/or Secretary of 
									Council, two other members of the Regional Mission Council, and the Chairperson of the Committee of Church and Ministry, or his/her nominee.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Report Affecting a Minister, Lay Pastor, Intern, or other Full-Time Worker
								</h3>
								<p>
									When a report affecting a Minister, Lay Pastor, Intern, or other Full-Time Worker is in circulation and involves a serious charge against 
									either his conduct or his teaching, The Regional Mission Council, through the Disciplinary Committee, institutes an Enquiry respecting the 
									rise of the report, the ground on which it rests, and if necessary, the persons originating it. The Minister, Lay Pastor, Intern, or other 
									Full-Time Worker is made aware of the intention to institute this Enquiry and has an opportunity to make such statements as he thinks 
									necessary. He is not to be present during this Enquiry unless the Committee deems his presence expedient.
								</p>

							<li>
								<h3>
									Witness at Enuiry
								</h3>
								<p>
									The rule under A-9 above in regard to the attendance of witnesses when summoned, shall apply.<br>

									Full-Time Worker does not prevent the Enquiry from taking place, if in the opinion of the Committee the Enquiry should proceed.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Settlement in Private
								</h3>
								<p>
									If it appears from the Enquiry that there exists proper ground for a charge, in accordance with Christian charity, the Minister, Lay

									declaration of the truth.

									the Minutes at The Regional Mission Council meeting which follows.

									functions of his office until the case is decided. Intimation to this effect must be made to his congregation by The Regional Mission 
									Council through an Interim Minster.<br>
									If the interdiction is disregarded by the accused, he shall be summarily dealt with for contempt and be deposed from office and 
									excommunicated.<br>
									<i>No Interdict</i> - If the accused is not interdicted, he may continue to exercise the functions of his office while the case is 
									being tried.<br>
